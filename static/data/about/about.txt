<p>I'm <b>David Newcomb Morales</b> and I started this website as a place to express myself through code / writing / drawing. Doing so has opened my eyes to all kinds of other <a href="https://blogscroll.com/">digital gardens</a> and <a href="https://indieweb.org" target="_blank">indie web</a> corners of the internet.</p>

<p>Ultimately, I'm far more interested in the creativity of humans than the outputs of machines. So I want to contribute what I've got to that humanist future.</p>

<p>Day to day, I work as a full-stack software engineer, and have leaned into the frontend lately. I still read and write poetry when I can, though most of my time / energy happily goes to my family and two little kids.</p>
