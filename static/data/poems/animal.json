{"text":"A silence engendered by the tipsy fall of leaves, \nA silence buoyed by the tingling wind.\nSuch vertigo, such precariously primal focus\nPeers just too far past the thinning edge -\nBroken! \nCrack! \nSun-sapped sticks\nWith a rush, now, with a snap.\nQuick scuttle of quicker feet.\nLook, \nRelax, \nRemember – \nSlowly and smoothly.\nMove the frame to a subtler fix.\nFasten your eyes and pray."}
