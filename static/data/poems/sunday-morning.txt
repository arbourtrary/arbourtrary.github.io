Known.
I know the place that he knew.
He knew what they knew.
We were farms or horses.
They were pastors or sheep.
They were strong as stone.
And just as ruined. By the time
We knelt at their altars,
I strained. Bodybagged,
Furrowed.
Lunging to dust.
I can pray or I can scream.
I mutter. Out of obedience.
