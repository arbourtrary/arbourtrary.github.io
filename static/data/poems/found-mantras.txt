Keep it light, loose and bizzare
One is all I need
(I can encrypt a zoo)
Like a precondition, forests were first.
Giambattista saw wandering giants as
A trope and a genre
Foreign, tragic.
Chaotic imagination that is the focus
And locus of poets.
We engage and encourage
With perfect contempt, nostalgia for utopia.

I seldom dislike doing nothing.
I am concerned less with truth than reality
On Sundays I speculate
On Mondays I dive

And do not emerge for a week
Bottle bound by the bottom of boozy
Description.
I cannot be the clearing that 
Overcomes dissolution. 
I am the clearing that
Is dissolved.
The desert. The beach.
I am remote. I am happy. I am common. I am judged.
If I cooperate, I will become my shadow.
