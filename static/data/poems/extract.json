{"text":"Allow me to recollect for you a piece of your imagination:\nBetween the sinewy matters, dimmed and gray,\nThrough willowy foresights, lightly betrayed.\nYou see: your dormant mariner, your flightless bird\nRose darkly from the deepening sea.\nCold ridges cracked, split by the seams,\nAnd spilt into various dreams.\nTwilight encircled, vulturing down\nShrouding the hint, the rhythm above,\nThough feathery stalks and mossy stones\nLingered to play with time.\nBefore the frail descent of words unheard,\nA final stream slipped in view,\nSoft light swimming in ripples.\nHere, your mirror slowed beyond motion,\nSteeped in its wake,\nSubdued in the stuff of perception."}
