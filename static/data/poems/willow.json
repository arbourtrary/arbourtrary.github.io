{"text":"My eyes unfocused used to peer\nPast droning highways’ woven ways,\nPast curving roads which disappear\nInto a blue forgotten haze.<br><br>\nMy mind unbridled used to dream\nOf jasmine, jade and amethyst,\nOf glass and onyx crystal streams\nImbued with fragrant ambergris.<br><br>\nYet once beneath the shade I lay,\nAlone and spent, in filthy sweat,\nNo will to stir, to sleep, to pray;\nHushed by fear, by crushing regret.<br><br>\nWith fevered thoughts, my mind did brood,\nThru stifled air and reckless heat: \nNo pain, no sting could I elude,\nA victim of my own deceit.<br><br>\nStill, clear above, I grew aware,\nA faceless wind, a smooth embrace,\nA peaceful bliss was gifted there,\nWith floating, mellow, silent grace.<br><br>\nSuspended by some drifting daze,\nDipping slightly with the breeze,\nDipping toward my vacant gaze:\nA willow’s vaguely rhythmic ease."}
