I change the way: to build, to break
To mold a cold culture into one
Brimming with cause
Shifting, adapt what you’ve learned
Create a compassionate economics
Invest in minds, livelihoods
There is a common cause, heartfelt
And universal, to set loose, set free
This is an emphatic formulation,
Empathetic formation
