Re-appear with me
In bountiful flashbacks
We married young, my love.
We’ll walk to grow redwood
Strong, turtle-wise.
Smooth as riverstone
Shaped by years
We’ll run to grow old.
We’ll sleep in meadow grass
Pray in humble coves.
But now, we sit uplifted,
Exchanging love
In glances, vows and gazes.
Heart to hand
To hand to heart,
Two souls, one life.
