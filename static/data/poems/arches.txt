They'd been emptied,
Strong and double-blind,
Neither side seeking.

They'd watched
Only for the soled walkers
That passed between,
Posed mostly
For the souled captors
That paused.

They'd heard words like mine:
Unsung words
Stung with a bit of dropsy.

Swollen up to barely fit together,

Classical capstone be demanded,
Forgotten,
And reprimanded.
