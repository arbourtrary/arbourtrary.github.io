Angled walls were made
To mitigate
This hilltop curve,
To retain a
Modern language.
Spanish-tiled roofs were made
To preserve tradition
With a patchwork flow.

Hammers echo
In the corridors
Between these cobbled
Structures.
Police sirens trace
Audible paths
In their canyons.

The river-ocean
Stretches a bit beyond,
A slow-changing, massive backdrop
Mostly viewed
From up close
Or up above.
The wind’s push is strong, but periodic.

A couple hammers
Ricochet.
