{"text":"I crossed rivers in sudden bounds\nStopping still at lonesome views.\nI took lessons from Jesus Christ\nLizards learning to leap on the water.\nI smoked heaven from paper pipes\nCurling wayward on your fickle secrets.\nI fought against tectonic plates\nFracturing quick in vertebrate zeal."}
