It’s almost a matter of spacing,
Of setting expectations.
Delicately set in rows
Olive trees quilt the curvilinear grounds.
To the west, limestone slabs
Nestle between the leaves
Flatten a slope and frame
A soft blue pool
Cypress trees trace a line
To a date tree, tall, symmetric
Standing proud beside the cornerstone:
Whitewashed villa, weathered Spanish tiles
Lush vines climbing columns
By the terraced lawn
And a view of the valley, the gorge
The canyon walls, vineyards
And ancient city:
Ronda desde el campo
Mi corazón canta y sueña de ti
