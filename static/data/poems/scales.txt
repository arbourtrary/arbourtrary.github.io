Tall grasses matted down
Into creekside cushions,
Cross-legged, I sit in hopes of rest
With a weariness that doesn’t translate.
There is a new world beneath me,
Shaded reprieve of minuscule passageways,
Canyons
I do not know how far a beetle scurries
Each hour, each day.
Condors drift lifetimes in flight
I spend years in search of quiet spots
Places unconcerned with footsteps.
