{"text":"Your time. Your pace. Your gaze.\nDrop them as nothing,\nShedded and shredded\nBy the shoulder side scraps\nOf your highwayed mind.\nGo ahead.\nPave another speedway\nWith a speed lane\nAnd a wasp name.<br><br>\nSo how goes the dream?\nStronger than ever\nWith the right kind of means<br><br>\nStep back\nRelease the thought\nQuicker than these quicker shots,\nStraight off a gun cocked top,\nFrom the trigger of a cop, stop, STOP!!!\nTen times more for broken bodies\nAnd a lifeless beat.<br><br>\nSo how goes the dream?\nStranger than never\nWith the white minded fiends."}
