{"text":"Without a single thought of Kubla\nKhan or the sound, illustrious Buddha,\nI’ve sat at the edge of many rivers.<br><br>\nSome, I cannot recall without an\nInsect buzz, a stinging ant.\nSome, I cannot recall without\nA longing that blurs\nWith the ease of eyes \nFalling blind.<br><br>\nIn others still, I cannot recall myself –\nI grow wild in observation\nStruck by the spirit,\nKindling of a soul\nDried up,\nAnd lit."}
