Bring it down into the page
That one’s iPhone
Wheels mechanics
Wrought by far more genius
Than we can pretend
To pretend to fathom.

His face is lit
But damn if it isn’t
A cold glow.
Don’t you wish
They could’ve spilled some
Warmth on the glass?
Don’t you
Hope you won’t
Have to stare, neck down,
For too many more
Years?
At least in the bar,
Some people pretend.
