{"text":"At the end of overgrown paths/\nI halt,/\nClose to the route, where/\nVoices tether loose loops/\nTo my ears, sliding free/\nAs invisible bodies march/\nAnother few feet./<br><br>\nSoon, I am hid at a vantage/\nWell above, as branches, as birds -/\nSolitary, aware of limits/\nShoulders to fingers/\nMore ground than sky/\nTethered in a harsher way/\nYearning and still./"}
