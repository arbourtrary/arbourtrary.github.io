I can replenish my mind with a color.
Noisy light
In flat glows,
Blurry diagrams
Of breezy intersections.

I can refresh my mind with a color.

Amorphous maps of
Shadow
Setting, resetting
Disappearing.
A settling pool of opacities.
I am partly submerged, partly breathing,
Spines, tendrils, stalks,
Exposed phylum, stony lichen.
