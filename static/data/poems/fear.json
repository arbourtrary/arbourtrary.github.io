{"text":"I built a steep retreat,<br><br>/\nHeart-centered in the city/\nWhose ruins peered through/\nPine and eucalyptus.<br><br>/\nI ran to it with thorns clawing my shins,/\nWith poison oak edging/\nRagged trails.<br><br>/\nI kicked up dusty masks/\nThat bound my throat/\nInto choked packets,/\nMade my eyes quiver, lungs heave.<br><br>/\nClimb./\nRun.<br><br>/\nInstinct boxed in broken context. Lost./\nI only muse it now./\nI gauge its decorations./"}
