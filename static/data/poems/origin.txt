Tripling worlds stretch back toward deep time
With careful rippling leaves, splayed
Into black and silent branches.
Orbic earth pulls in each direction,
Death-defying, yet barren,
Precarious in its watchful slumber;
Trees and sand creep upward,
Looming with a shaded hush,
Waiting for the noise to come.
Clouds in a softened glow
Prepare for the watchmen,
The observant and fleeting.
In final moments,
A peaceful expectation grows;
A clean, abundant clarity:
The elegant, natural pose.
