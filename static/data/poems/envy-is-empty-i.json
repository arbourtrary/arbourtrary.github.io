I claim my hilltop/\nOpposite the fenced and manicured/\nWithering their bald rooftops and/\nVacuumed lawns with disappointment across the valley/\nTo create vacant spaces out of bounty:/\nThis is the proprietary trick of the rich/\nI see ravens, circling, channeling,/\nVulturing. They, too, sense a carcass./"}
