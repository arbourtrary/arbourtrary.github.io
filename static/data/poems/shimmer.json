{"text":"There it goes…\nDon’t let it disappear amongst the \nWhispering boughs, sliding away \nIn the softly dimming, refracting\nSunset.  Grasp it.  Hold it.  Kiss it.\nIn a fraction of a moment, it will\nFall through the frivolous gaps\nIn your half-clenched fist,\nAnd not a word \nWill be spoken."}
