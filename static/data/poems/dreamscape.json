{"text":"I sometimes take a wayward glance,\nA careless tilt to the unlit night,\nWhere subtle thoughts reach from within,\nWhere clouds crafted from cotton\nThin out in delicate strands.\nSwimming with quivering breath,\nThe stars begin to wax, to wane, to wax, to wane,\nAs a lonesome train bellows in haste\nTo the faded sky.<br><br>\nI find a peace, a careful solemnity\nIn this strolling rite,\nWhere a gleaming river passes by,\nAnd a coin’s quick arc disappears.\nFor the night is filled with ghastly things:\nA half-caught glimpse and startled sight.\nFor better or worse, recollected or not,\nI see the sleepless mare and sweetened soul\nThat stir and dance beneath this moon."}
