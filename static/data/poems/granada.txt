Before you arrived
There was greenery flanked by reddish cliffs
When you arrived, a separate vision grew.
You ordered the iron clay molded
The layered stone extracted.
You lifted walls, minarets
From the earth below
And left savage trees crowding
Stark fortifications.

Within, you hid miracles,
Developed the mathematics of symmetry
Carved truths.
You set water to exalted motion
Softened its touch on marble,
And scented the air with jasmine.

Centuries of disrepair did nothing
But increase its splendor
Imagined colors shine brighter
Pictured trees, gardens, rooms
Vivid in this monument
