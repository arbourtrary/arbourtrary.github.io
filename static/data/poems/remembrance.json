{"text":"Amidst the crush and hurry,\nI give you a scene.\nBare back slumped\nAgainst an oaken door,\nEyes half shut, mouth agape,\nMind awash on distant shores.<br><br>\nWithin the boundary,\nI give you a snap.\nPupils constrict, react,\nWith a focus upward peering:\nNothing but the Book, a cross,\nCaught in the lamplight.<br><br>\nTo stir the air,\nI leave you a breeze.\nSkin bristles with that sudden chill,\nMuscles tense, head tilted,\nLocked for a look\nLong and long at the lonely moon."}
