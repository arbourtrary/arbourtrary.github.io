Posture is less important than posturing
(Morally and physically)
Structural integrity can be feigned
And should be.
Belief in this underpinning
Drives our technology, our politics, our construction.
We draw lines in the sand.
To show our mettle
When the wind erases them
We look somewhere else - a more recent line?
Another stretch of beach?
