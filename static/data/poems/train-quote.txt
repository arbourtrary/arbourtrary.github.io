I overheard a rider:
“We’re nightfish
Fast. Hungry.”
We spill our tank at each stop
And when it gets late, you know, this late -
We don’t replenish.

I wanted to call us mannequins
That one sits. This one stands. Casual, tall. Still.
Nobody swims.

We were a little alive, a little lifeless.
Small chatter, long stares.
Finding floors and corners
No faces interjecting
Maybe “fish” was right.

I don’t think I’ve ever seen one
Look me in the eye.
