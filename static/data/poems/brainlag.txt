The way your blood settles
Into timezones
The quiet limits of body
And invention
The strength of orbits
And spheres.
We belong to where we’ve been
Sundown, stomach sluggish
Vaulted into passive airspace
Tough footing slowly found
We stumble until we crash
On couches or pillows
In malingering afternoons
