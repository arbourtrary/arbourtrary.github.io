Skip the shadowy introductions
Interlaced with a mindless aura
Of necessity, carelessly invoking
A weary ritual of bygone days.
Go headlong into the fiery rush
Of adrenaline burning slender veins
Pumping overpowering sensations
With each tingling passion piercing
Every little fibrous nerve.
Shake the dust of dying books.
