Spokes in revolution,
Inordinate time, numerical sign
Switch-switch-switched
Backed up - no - reversed (no)
Illusion of frame.
Revered, referred, stored - 
Steel never stolen, un-shared.
Brake often broken, padlocked
To post, subterranean platform
Click,
walk, click, walk, click, click click-click
Missed it, tired, flat out of breath
Bumpy lean, pressed cloth
Off kilter with a close ratio
No bridle, no saddle, gymnastic
Handle (nearly)
Swerved, left leg, swung right
Gliding.
