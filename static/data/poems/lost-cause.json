{"text":"A moment past my patience waiting in the woods,/\nA kind of endeavor stirs in my feet, my fingers,/\nA curiosity to learn how I interact./<br><br>\nWhere can I glide?/\nWhere am I just noise?/\nWill my limbs pull me skyward in oaken arms?/\nWill my stone skip as smooth, fast, effortless, inevitable/\nAs the wave that will consume it?/"}
