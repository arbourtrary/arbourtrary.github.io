It was subtle.
I couldnt've picked
Myself out of that crowd.

Even the tropical
Flavors played along,
Faded themselves
As a favor
To blend
With our muted vanity.

Blue is black is gray is blue.

Nothing gave much of a mutiny:
Not the woodworked ceiling,
Not the plastered moments
Of artistic explosions
Hanging in hunted trophy style.

We mostly settled.

Ate a slice or two of pricey bread.
