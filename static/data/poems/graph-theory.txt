To be yarn-strung
Together
Looped through our sleeves
With small hooks and wires.

To be railcar
And subway commuters.

This is how the {Valley, Bay} connects.

Just enough crosstalk.
A few cliques (clicks).
Apple !xor Google at hand.

Another conductor
Manning the speaker.
Fumbling the same directions
From time to time.
