A blanket mutes
Parts of the hillside
Patterned in dark
Green spades,
Sprinkled with purple
Morning-glory blooms.

Leaning down to
The river, shadows
Dealt cool passages.

Once homes, now ruins
Lay beneath.

The stubborn base of
A chimney rises
To a covered dome.

One roof nearby
Staves off the ivy mass.
Its rusted and ribbed
Steel sheets
Are carefully layered.

It’s getting past dusk
And no one inside
Has turned on a light.
