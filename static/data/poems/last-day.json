{"text":"romance is lost without absence/\na sheltered pair lounges in the car/\nlistens to fifties crooners sing the heavens/\nas heavy blue tails slather tri-color soap/\nfrom sunroof to wheel rims/\nthey smile to know no wandering eyes/\ncan pierce this foamy shell/\nthey lie in mechanic respiration/"}
