What mind wants to see the world
Through a grid, this prison turned prism
That does more to delight
Than to illuminate
(False soothsayer)
I’m tired of data, equations and calculation
If I don’t generate ideas, I’m a shitty computer
Let the machine do what it does better
I’ll sleep, wander, taste and fuck
