{"text":"Trees are not poems/\nAnd are not designed/\nTo be the deaths/\nWe so long for them to be./<br><br>\nTrees get struck down/\nBy the sky/\nGet split up by the sky,/\nStruggle in its chest/\nAnd grimace/\nWith its deeper inhalations./<br><br>\nA tree is a mangled,/\nPock-marked truth/\nThat managed its way/\nWith genetics and luck/\nTo be the flat frame/\nThat you don’t understand./<br><br>\nSpend a minute, an hour/\nA sunset/\nIn its sturdy arms./<br><br>\nThen speak to me of/\nThe poetic earth/\nThat draws upon the sky./"}
