I stared, caught in a window.

The staff, the cook,
The cleaning crew: they
Walked around
In a Miyazaki light.
It wasn’t surreal
But it should’ve been.

They moved in a shredded screen.

Disjointed by the blinds,
Their serving trays were
Striped, and their
Arms were striped.
They dressed and walked
In dismembered
Dizzy
Plaid.
