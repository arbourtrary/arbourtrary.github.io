Find me an afternoon
That teeters on the edge of warmth
The type of day where cold feet and old cats
Search for sunspots on the carpet
Where heat grows only
From stillness and patience.
In these hours, you’ll find me
In a windless nook of the woods,
Sunlit, letting my cotton t-shirt shoulders
Launder and bake into reptilian comfort.
I’ll stand in this clearing, unmoving,
Until the shadows angle
Or the breeze
Shows me another window.
