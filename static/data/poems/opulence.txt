Give me your tongue,
Scrolling from your mouth.
Give me your words.

I’m not here to scoop them up,
Splattered.

I will not prod
With forceps poking tonsils,
Plucking into your throat.

Liquor lacquered eyes look through me.
Pitter patter steps pass me.

I will be invisible
Where you need me to hide.
I will listen.

I long
To hear you slang.
