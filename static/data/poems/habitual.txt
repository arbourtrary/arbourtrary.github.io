I promise there are weeds out here

Weeds thornier
Than some
Nightmare spinach
That would poison you
With a gut
More busted up
Than Popeye’s
Swollen
Jaw.

We're hungry on the stoop.

Our skulls throb
In empty elbows.
We’ve had our fill
Of venom greens.

Been chewed by them, spit out and
Curled up cold with an ache
To disappear.
