{"text":"Slow-volt spine,/\nMeters measured in metrics:/\nSandgrains dislodged/\nVagabonds discouraged/\nMoney turned monied/\nTo the sweet glass ground/\nI’ll laugh when you fail to see your reflection/\nI’ll fail to find your truth./\nI’d prefer you pilfer me in the open day/\nAnd let me slide to struggle/"}
