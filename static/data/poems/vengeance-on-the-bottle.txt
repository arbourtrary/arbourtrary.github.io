Listen close cause
This isn't Langston's
Drowsy tune.

It belongs to someone else,
Someone tilted, jaunty, rumbling up.

The nighttime booms.

Streets borne from
Plastic bucket beats
Escape the muni stairs
To sprawl around.

Steady noise
Baselines
A chorus.

Frantic noise
Revels
In weed whispers,
Vomit and sewer steam.

Market trades in close injections,

Deals drunken human laughter
For a couple earnest
Sermons.

It's all music
It's all a mix
It's all amuck
With reluctant
Joy.
