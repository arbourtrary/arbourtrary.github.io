Footstep stops stepping foot
On the pavement square,
Ripflows outward where
Corner meets root,

Upward
Where skyglass shakes,
Thinly sunlit and beautiful.

Vines lace and stitch themselves
To rare heights,
Here,
On the bankdrawn backbones
Of monied behemoths.

Their vicegrip
Sheds concrete crumbs,
A handful a day:
Voracious, clean.
