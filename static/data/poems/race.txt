Your time. Your pace. Your gaze.
Drop them as nothing,
Shedded and shredded
By the shoulder side scraps
Of your highwayed mind.
Go ahead.
Pave another speedway
With a speed lane
And a wasp name.

So how goes the dream?
Stronger than ever
With the right kind of means

Step back
Release the thought
Quicker than these quicker shots,
Straight off a gun cocked top,
From the trigger of a cop, stop, STOP!!!
Ten times more for broken bodies
And a lifeless beat.

So how goes the dream?
Stranger than never
With the white minded fiends.
