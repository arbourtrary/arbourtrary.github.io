Did truth spurn you?/\nHad you deconstructed your flimsy self?/\nDid you ponder praise? Secretly pray/\nFor misinterpretation? For reinvigoration?/\nI heard you trail off/\nNext breath building sharply in lungs ballooned/\nHeartbeat both stopped and pounding/\nBrain barely able to repeat/\nThat little question./"}
