I, you (we) cast lives
Into gaps of printed words
We brush flows over aging pigment
Narrative creatures that we are
Movement, movement
We need motion, arcing,
Action to freedom
I want to tell us (you)
A story in perspective, a new story
In perspective
(How clear you have been)
Cleared and estranged
There are traces and notes,
Compelling notes
And many, many echoes
