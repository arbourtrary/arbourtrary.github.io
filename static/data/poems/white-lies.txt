I saw SF from a rooftop
Or a hill or an island.
It was the sunrise once
But more often the sunset.
Sometimes it was the nighttime.
And each time
It was the light
That burnt or broke
The image.

San Francisco is a melodic mirage
(2:17 PM on a September Sunday)
San Francisco is a foggy basin
San Francisco is colder than its homes care to admit

San Francisco is just as cold
As its homeless admit.
(5 AM of almost every morning).
