At the end of overgrown paths
I halt,
Close to the route, where
Voices tether loose loops
To my ears, sliding free
As invisible bodies march
Another few feet.

Soon, I am hid at a vantage
Well above, as branches, as birds -
Solitary, aware of limits
Shoulders to fingers
More ground than sky
Tethered in a harsher way
Yearning and still.
