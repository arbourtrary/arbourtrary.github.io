{"text":"I know I’ve caught a rare remark/\nWhen she giggles, little bit of gums showing-/\nEyes squinting soft,/<br><br>\nOr when she stares,/\nRelentless/\nHeart blazed in disbelief/<br><br>\nI seek these moments/\nWith an equal but opposite passion/\nI flurry, word wise and wonderful/\nI parry, ashamed./"}
