Identify these
Channeled youth
As the base
Of a bastardized movement.

Hunger as a spiritual construct
As a lyrical concept
It feels played out . . .
They declared independence
Gained the freedom
To bound their own lands
To draw lines
Where before there had
Been rivers or canyons
Or swaths of sand.
