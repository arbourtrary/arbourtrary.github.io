I think you heard about the rally?
All down Market?

Scientists marched for science.

They joined the crowds
Of causes so far gone
They’ve swung all the way
Back again.

&emsp;I'm lazy to do this,
&emsp;To wheel out my
&emsp;Pendulum as a trope.
&emsp;It’s a cop out,
&emsp;And I'm tired.

It's lazy - you and me, 
We never account for friction.
We don't remember
That the gears grow old.

We never watch long enough to hear
The heat and rust
Squeak its arm into
Downright stillness.

We get distracted, let ourselves 
Wander, but somehow still

Act unsurprised
When the bob
Shoots awry.

We shout (to ourselves)
In a knowing tone
That History took its course again.
That Humanity will, of course,
Repeat its awful self.

Sometimes

We don't even check to see
Who shoved the weight.
