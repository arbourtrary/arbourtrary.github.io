I once had a shaman show me
The mechanics that loose the mind.
She said to begin with symmetric
Variance of a slanted, peculiar kind.
Her final steps were simple rules
Forgotten now to verse and time.

I once had a showman awe me
With linguistics that nearly rhymed.
He said to begin with poetic
Variants of enchanted, shrewder lines.
His final words were wistful tools
For getting past a versed design.
