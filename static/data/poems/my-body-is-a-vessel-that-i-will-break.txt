I’m aging into fears
Doubts left unexplored.
Beginning to worry
I’ve been crossing lines
Everyone else could already see
Tiptoeing high branches
&emsp;(Head in the clouds)
Trespassing pathways
&emsp;(Head in the dirt)
My muscles alerted me first
Told me how unsure I was becoming.
How tired. How unbalanced.
