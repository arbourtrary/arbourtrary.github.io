You don’t need to climb too high
To notice how small you are
Eight or nine feet will do
You don’t need to sink too low
To notice how tall you’ve been
Someone in the middle might say this
Half involved in their own life
Watching themselves play out brevity
And its skirmishes with meaning.
Many metaphors meant many people,
Or fractions of people
Saw each other’s moons askew
Their errors writ large, writ law
Lunatics come no more from the heavens
Than they do from the dirt
