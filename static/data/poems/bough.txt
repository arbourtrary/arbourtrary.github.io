To ascend with ease, to slip
Through unnoticed, swaying
With silent precision to the
Hidden rhythms of the breeze;
To glide transcendentally
Along soft, natural spirals,
As summery warmth abounds
And bounces, fading into shade:
Herein lies that tranquil gloss
Of jade inlaid with amethyst.
Yes herein lies that peaceful calm
Of sweetened soothing jasmine wisps.
