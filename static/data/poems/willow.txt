My eyes unfocused used to peer
Past droning highways’ woven ways,
Past curving roads which disappear
Into a blue forgotten haze.

My mind unbridled used to dream
Of jasmine, jade and amethyst,
Of glass and onyx crystal streams
Imbued with fragrant ambergris.

Yet once beneath the shade I lay,
Alone and spent, in filthy sweat,
No will to stir, to sleep, to pray;
Hushed by fear, by crushing regret.

With fevered thoughts, my mind did brood,
Thru stifled air and reckless heat: 
No pain, no sting could I elude,
A victim of my own deceit.

Still, clear above, I grew aware,
A faceless wind, a smooth embrace,
A peaceful bliss was gifted there,
With floating, mellow, silent grace.

Suspended by some drifting daze,
Dipping slightly with the breeze,
Dipping toward my vacant gaze:
A willow’s vaguely rhythmic ease.
