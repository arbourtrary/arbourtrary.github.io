Bluegrass, careful, unequivocal
Spiky here, shaved there,
Earthfur bristling,
Cold in summer’s windy fever.
There is a gradual slope of green
That picks up speed and picks up steam
And careens into a cliff
Whose bottom I dare not see.

By that precipice,
The patchy weeds
Tell me there is no depth to this soil,
Nothing firm in the footing.
I should retreat to the shadow of trees,
Lean against them,
Let my page wonder what goes on below.
