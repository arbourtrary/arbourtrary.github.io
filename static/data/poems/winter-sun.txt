The wind is in all four facets of bloom,
Flow and weave, cold cheek
With a warm temple.

These lines are inlets,
Coves eroding caves.

A cicada emits electricity,
Thrumming crackle.
A gust of reckless traffic.
My frame of reference is inverted.
I walk where I’d rather ramble.

A sense of life and lovely loss,
Rotten rind and apple blossom.
