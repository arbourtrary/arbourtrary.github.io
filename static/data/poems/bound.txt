Giant of the urban edge,
Redwood tower fortified
And flanking the crosswalk

You stand corralled and cordoned off
By short-fenced lining.

A net of flies frenzies
At your base,
Strips and mines the layered decay.

Brown thatchery to bark
To spiral branches
Spindling deepest green
In the isolate canopy.

I would stay a while if...
