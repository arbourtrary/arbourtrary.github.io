{"text":"What’s left of a downpour?/\nRaindrops caught in flared petals/\nSkyfall splashed/\nInto spiderwebbed dew/\nInto haphazard permanence/\nBefore We - the sun, the bees -/\nResume entropy’s business/<br><br>\nPerched on outstretched stalks:/\nRigid liquid -/\nA varnish spilled here, beaded there/\nLittle spheres, tense with geometry,/\nSweat on the lip of a jar./"}
