Windlash, whiplash leading down the folds
The turns, the mountain slope
Ending here:
A burned and blackened crescent trunk
Five feet tall in mossy ruin
A nicely built wooden deck
Stuck beneath a sandstone skull
Cavernous eyes, a hollow nose
Looming tilted and mouth empty,
I have felt this thin before
And am thinner than I know.
My stillness will last a handful of seconds,
My thinness a handful of years.
The skull already knows this
And cannot forget.
It stares down.
I turn around,
Walk back to face the wind.
