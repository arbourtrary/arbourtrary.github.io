I could have begun with a purple hue,
Dipped in the nighttime luster – 
Though you may not have cared 
To see the color through.

I could have shown some shaded leaves
Strangely lit beneath the dusk,
Falling as silent droplets drop
To smooth the jagged earth.

I could have sung a midnight thrush
Tut, tut, oh-lay-oh-leeeee!
It’s liquid trill precise and clean,
It’s flutelike song so quickly hushed.

But I began with the bonewhite path,
With steps of dust and shadow
Past sleeping limbs, now darkly green,
In a dappled moonlit glow.
