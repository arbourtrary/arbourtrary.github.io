Cobwebs turn to lint
And there is nothing on the vine.
Dry constriction,
Patchwork of a helix past.
Armadillo scurry and dig,
Voronoi body and rat tail,
Suspended leaf on a single thread.
Twirl and swing, a country dance.
Something stoic and dark and small watches,
A tumor in the forest. A stone’s throw,
Transfixed.
