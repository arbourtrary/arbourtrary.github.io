Mouse, cat, man,
Sequence of quiet.
Long line after the writhing.
A body for the compost,
One for the grave, one for the sea.
One hundred, one and young.
A day changes little.
A century changes less than you might think.
Steady - time, for him, was strong and slow.
And he was for me, for a decade, time.
Ten years since, one year until…
He made it, he missed her - their love, their time.
He saw her in the room,
He’ll meet her in the sea.
