When this hotel
Is your home,
This sidewalk
Is your porch.

And on this day when
Smoke
Hangs in the discolored
Air

The stalled cars vibrating (humming)
In late September heat
Are a mess of dogs
Urinating sweat and gasoline
Onto your lawn.

When they sit, you
Shuffle noisily past
The muzzled (muffled) lot,

You greet your neighbors on the other side.
Your small talk burns the afternoon.
