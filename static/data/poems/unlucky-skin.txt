Give the pluck a fucking rest
Gimme some strum-drop-strum
Beat, strum-drop-strum thump
Bass and backbeat drum, stump, back weak-knee strum
Croon a voice of country pluck
Spread a drop of country folk, damn, wisdom
Spill my city veins with clean, clean fold-ing
I long til I belong, shake til I share my grave
Numb in the mirror, mute -
And I will strain my jaw
Clench my teeth, my teeth to listen
I need sound when silence spills
I am absent
I am gut-strung from wires
Alight, I float
Endometrial echoes perform orchestrally
[Fuck that noise]
Ban-ban-jo, rise, damn, rise, rise
Crescendo
