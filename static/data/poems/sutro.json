{"text":"Windlash, whiplash leading down the folds/\nThe turns, the mountain slope/\nEnding here:/\nA burned and blackened crescent trunk/\nFive feet tall in mossy ruin/\nA nicely built wooden deck/\nStuck beneath a sandstone skull/\nCavernous eyes, a hollow nose/\nLooming tilted and mouth empty,/\nI have felt this thin before/\nAnd am thinner than I know./\nMy stillness will last a handful of seconds,/\nMy thinness a handful of years./\nThe skull already knows this/\nAnd cannot forget./\nIt stares down./\nI turn around,/\nWalk back to face the wind./"}
