{"text":"Tall grasses matted down/\nInto creekside cushions,/\nCross-legged, I sit in hopes of rest/\nWith a weariness that doesn’t translate./\nThere is a new world beneath me,/\nShaded reprieve of minuscule passageways,/\nCanyons/\nI do not know how far a beetle scurries/\nEach hour, each day./\nCondors drift lifetimes in flight/\nI spend years in search of quiet spots/\nPlaces unconcerned with footsteps./"}
