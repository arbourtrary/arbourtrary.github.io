Mesmerizing: fractals of leaves were forgotten,
Dropped in the past by a passing wind
While prayers drifted, ceaseless,
And empty spaces began to drown.
I suppose there was not a great deal of time
Without boulders slowly breaking,
Grinding down to dust.
Although sacred muds of certain shores
Maintain their fluid form,
Both fine and heraclitic,
Our instinct doubly softens:
Now, man forgets his shifting faces,
And with unseen toes,
Dips down in foggy waters.
Whether dawn or dusk, 
His half-dreamt dark does not betray,
And whether past or prologue
Remains untold until the day.
