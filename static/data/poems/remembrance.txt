Amidst the crush and hurry,
I give you a scene.
Bare back slumped
Against an oaken door,
Eyes half shut, mouth agape,
Mind awash on distant shores.

Within the boundary,
I give you a snap.
Pupils constrict, react,
With a focus upward peering:
Nothing but the Book, a cross,
Caught in the lamplight.

To stir the air,
I leave you a breeze.
Skin bristles with that sudden chill,
Muscles tense, head tilted,
Locked for a look
Long and long at the lonely moon.
