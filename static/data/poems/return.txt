Remember the rising dawn,
Each slumber filled blink
Waking you to dreams of another dreamer,
To a warm and slow embrace.

Remember the wand’ring day,
The paths meandering, the ocean drifting,
As you smiled with summer’s sun
And laughed with peaceful eyes.

Remember the fading night,
So smooth and softly hushed,
As your lips momently hovered,
Whispering love with a kiss.
