Humid teatime vapor, phosphorescent blue, color burned sky
A stagnant afternoon, trees clenched - tensed - flexed - clenched
Shimmering signals, noise/buzz, dehydrated vision
Glared - staticked
I select circumstances - avocal - implicit
It’s been awhile since I operated in thought
Not snapshot
In lists, to tasks, with fragments, out of flow
Separated from myself, automaton
Markov state by state, discrete
I am one, unified, languid or lurching, leaping
I am, memoryless, in motion
