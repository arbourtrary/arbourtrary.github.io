Silver and fire dripped in syrupy orbs
Down the sky’s wide chest
Into a wrinkled plain yearning
For a departure from spent cartridges,
Spilt by steel barrels
Exploding anger toward the clouds.
As if in a hazy dreamscape
Defined by the synaptic blue,
Trees more surreal than Dali’s
Swayed to dance and catch
Each gleaming globule floating
Through the viscous canvas.		
Over the smiling face of sunny waters,
Defined within the mind of Hiawatha,
This bewildering array rained forth
From the firmament in laborious
Repetition and silent premonition
Of morphing moths into dragonflies.
Like fog thinning in a waking jungle,
The dimming numbness slid away
As drip, drop, drip, drop agápe
Bathed the earth in susurrus tones.
