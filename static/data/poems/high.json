{"text":"Buy me smoked, wrung out/\nOn the line/\nTobacco was made in the dry sun, an accident/\nI am cooked the same/\nBasted and blistered/\nIn moonless heat/<br><br>\nI am roughly sane/\nA spoke to B and B to me/\nWe wrote it down/\nWe crossed it out items/\nA tried some music./\nB stared out the window./\nMy eyes gave out before my ears/\nSo I felt for rumblings/\nAwful groans and yawns giving way/"}
