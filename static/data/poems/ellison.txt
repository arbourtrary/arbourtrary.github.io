Many layers below,
Cables orchestrated our
Electric feast

Smooth-sounded backing on the beat
Socialite scrolling,
Flameless evenings
Mothed in a MOMA glow.

Twenty miles away,
Capacitors stood
Like military grade
Tombstones,
Ground-rooted and gridded.

Somewhere still beyond,
The sun dropt notes
In pastel

Its colors blurred by cooling tower
Plumes and a pilot light.
