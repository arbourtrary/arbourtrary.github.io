I am the slow-volt spine,
Vertebrae spliced from bark
Beer-drunk and thrashing
In close spurts.

I go round and round
In hopeless twists.

Boredom steals
My enskulled (ensconced) aura:
Tosses it into random buckets
That I cannot find.
So I stare, gut-hungry and pitiful.

Plants and plans and lands tend to hermit
In my book-bred brainspace:
A terrain sieved through grave debilitations.

My father moved knowingly (slowly)
In casket situations.
My mother moved briskly
(Broke)

Yet still I walk. 
Still I sit. 
Sudden I wake.

I know
That from 17 feet away
There are treetops taller
Than planetips or planets.
Sunsets lower than crowds.

So when I make that choice
To return, 
I will land softly from the prison top

Not concrete, not versioned
Nor versed

Only masked
As Daedalus or sleep.
