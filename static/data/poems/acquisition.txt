How to come face to face
With a capitalist itch
How to lend your hands (sacrificial)
Digging wealth,
Hand it in heaps
To your smiling, jack-faced lords
(Yes they’ll be men)
(Yes they’ll be clean as sheets)
So that they (They, too, are stunned)
May do
As
They so wish to do.
The firm will grip
Your filthy hands
With strong gaps - bovine - (eyes to match)
Palms flexed
In business sense
Straining to move on
