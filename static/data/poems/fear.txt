I built a steep retreat,

Heart-centered in the city
Whose ruins peered through
Pine and eucalyptus.

I ran to it with thorns clawing my shins,
With poison oak edging
Ragged trails.

I kicked up dusty masks
That bound my throat
Into choked packets,
Made my eyes quiver, lungs heave.

Climb.
Run.

Instinct boxed in broken context. Lost.
I only muse it now.
I gauge its decorations.
