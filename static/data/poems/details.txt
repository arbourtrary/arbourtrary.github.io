What’s left of a downpour?
Raindrops caught in flared petals
Skyfall splashed
Into spiderwebbed dew
Into haphazard permanence
Before We - the sun, the bees -
Resume entropy’s business

Perched on outstretched stalks:
Rigid liquid -
A varnish spilled here, beaded there
Little spheres, tense with geometry,
Sweat on the lip of a jar.
