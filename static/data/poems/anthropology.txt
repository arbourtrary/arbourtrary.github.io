Lands seem to lock with language
Rolling, agitated, calm, brusque
Peoples with their earth
I can see them
Firmly grasping soil,
Damp, freshly tilled
Briskly walking contours by intuition.

Many crave this understanding
Expansive and deep
For centuries, a family rests
Where it remains.
Until a child grows too restless,
Cannot maintain the charade
Planted fields dry up - stubborn husks
Cling to the end.
Even roots, in time, wither.
People roam.
They trade waters, populate new homes
Find another landscape calling.
