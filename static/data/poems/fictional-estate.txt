We sat on the trespass side
Of the chain-link fence.
And got used to sitting there -
Next to the milkweed,
Fog residue facing
From the hilltop.

We felt big enough
To fill that empty lot,
Loose enough to balance
Beam our way across its
Old foundations.

We traced the outlines
Of a home there.

We broke the thicket
Of walls and doors.

We knew how young we had to be.
