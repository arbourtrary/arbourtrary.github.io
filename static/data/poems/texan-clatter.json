{"text":"Cobwebs turn to lint/\nAnd there is nothing on the vine./\nDry constriction,/\nPatchwork of a helix past./\nArmadillo scurry and dig,/\nVoronoi body and rat tail,/\nSuspended leaf on a single thread./\nTwirl and swing, a country dance./\nSomething stoic and dark and small watches,/\nA tumor in the forest. A stone’s throw,/\nTransfixed./"}
