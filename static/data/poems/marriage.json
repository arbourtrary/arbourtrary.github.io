{"text":"Re-appear with me/\nIn bountiful flashbacks/\nWe married young, my love./\nWe’ll walk to grow redwood/\nStrong, turtle-wise./\nSmooth as riverstone/\nShaped by years/\nWe’ll run to grow old./\nWe’ll sleep in meadow grass/\nPray in humble coves./\nBut now, we sit uplifted,/\nExchanging love/\nIn glances, vows and gazes./\nHeart to hand/\nTo hand to heart,/\nTwo souls, one life./"}
