{"text":"A blanket mutes/\nParts of the hillside/\nPatterned in dark/\nGreen spades,/\nSprinkled with purple/\nMorning-glory blooms./<br><br>\nLeaning down to/\nThe river, shadows/\nDealt cool passages./<br><br>\nOnce homes, now ruins/\nLay beneath./<br><br>\nThe stubborn base of/\nA chimney rises/\nTo a covered dome./<br><br>\nOne roof nearby/\nStaves off the ivy mass./\nIts rusted and ribbed/\nSteel sheets/\nAre carefully layered./<br><br>\nIt’s getting past dusk/\nAnd no one inside/\nHas turned on a light./"}
