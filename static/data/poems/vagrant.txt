Disappearing into neglected woods,
Past a dirt path toward a tangle of trees,
I scraped and I struggled
Through spiraling thorns embedded
In bark, in shade, in flesh.
For some troubled time, I shuffled and turned,
I twisted and ducked, contortedly
Forging the wooded trail.

With sweat on my lips and dust on my tongue,
I wiped my brow, as fingers unfurled.
Over thinning twigs and fallen trees,
With a final ascent, I reached for plains,
Open in air, searching the sky
Its simple blue drifting through
My ever-wandering eye.
