It rains here too.
At least I heard it does.
Heard the noise
It dampens.

I’ve also heard
The noise it spurs.
Mad honks,
Wet-lashed umbrellas,
And laughs of lovers
Caught without one.

I’ve seen the people too.
Some get caught off guard -
They usually hurry through.
Some get caught on guard,
And they hurry too -
Barely make it
To stationary sedan doors.

Some can’t get caught.
They huddle in the same spots.
Grit their teeth and hope it stops.
