{"text":"I could have begun with a purple hue,\nDipped in the nighttime luster – \nThough you may not have cared \nTo see the color through.<br><br>\nI could have shown some shaded leaves\nStrangely lit beneath the dusk,\nFalling as silent droplets drop\nTo smooth the jagged earth.<br><br>\nI could have sung a midnight thrush\nTut, tut, oh-lay-oh-leeeee!\nIt’s liquid trill precise and clean,\nIt’s flutelike song so quickly hushed.<br><br>\nBut I began with the bonewhite path,\nWith steps of dust and shadow\nPast sleeping limbs, now darkly green,\nIn a dappled moonlit glow."}
