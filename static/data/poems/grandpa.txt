These books are made of leather,
Hand heavy with trimmings
Brushed in gold.
We open the fronts
A thin few pages
At a time.

We open the backs the same.
Then front.
Then back.

A holy rite
Midward creasing.

We learn that the binding
Breathes this way,
Shivers and settles
Into new life.

Old to ancient words
Popping up
For fresh delights.
