I visited some familiar trees
Saw the old footholds, grips,
Stretches, contortions and cradles.
I imagined my forest seats
Leglocked and body balanced
I remembered these lithe and lovely wooded homes
Movements
Of lively springing
Climbing, gliding, silent things
Wind in the weeds
I was guided, had strength to follow
Blessing of youth
My wild, scattered heart
