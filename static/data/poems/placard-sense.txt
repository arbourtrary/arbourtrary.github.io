Trees are not poems
And are not designed
To be the deaths
We so long for them to be.

Trees get struck down
By the sky
Get split up by the sky,
Struggle in its chest
And grimace
With its deeper inhalations.

A tree is a mangled,
Pock-marked truth
That managed its way
With genetics and luck
To be the flat frame
That you don’t understand.

Spend a minute, an hour
A sunset
In its sturdy arms.

Then speak to me of
The poetic earth
That draws upon the sky.
