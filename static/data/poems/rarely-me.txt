People tell me it’s an ahistorical city,
Markov’s city,
Everyone new taking and trading places
Lined up, short line, long line, or next.
Always next.
Everyone old is waiting, trapped or relieved.
Success or failure, I meant it: relieved.

The unsettled increasingly move
Their unsettling rattles neighbors
Their moves make me shudder.
I might be them,
I should listen,
But always I do look past them
I can nod with definition,
Almost certain
Yet always I do look past them.
