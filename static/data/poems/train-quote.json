Hungry.”/\nWe spill our tank at each stop/\nAnd when it gets late, you know, this late -/\nWe don’t replenish./<br><br>\nI wanted to call us mannequins/\nThat one sits. This one stands. Casual, tall. Still./\nNobody swims./<br><br>\nWe were a little alive, a little lifeless./\nSmall chatter, long stares./\nFinding floors and corners/\nNo faces interjecting/\nMaybe “fish” was right./<br><br>\nI don’t think I’ve ever seen one/\nLook me in the eye./"}
