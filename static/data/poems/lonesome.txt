Stoned in the back of
A barroom
Bricks broken barely able
To spell.

I left my bike
Bone-locked
On the streetside
Checked on it from the window
Strolled up and out
Of the edge.

I was numb.
And there was a lot of sound -
Felt like bamboozled bamboo
Like baboon’s booze

I couldn’t tell you
I couldn’t yell to you
That some corners
Should be left.
