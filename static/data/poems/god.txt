I ask with a whisper,
Through a veil in the shadows.
There is wind – it feels cool.

Motions become slow,
Meandering as each bemused
Syllable waltzes with the moon.
There is light – it looks soft.

Long whistles, strung in tune
Sculpt this dream with memory.
Whimsy soothes the mind
With a gentle, lulling sleep.
