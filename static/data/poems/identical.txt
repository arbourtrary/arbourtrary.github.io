I don’t have roots
I was dug from the earth (molded from many clays)
Born into lost words and
Freefalling freedom

I am one of those Americans bound to land
And nowhere to place this conviction
Schools raised me to claim
My inheritance.
Whitman claimed I contained
These lands in my body,
In my expression, boundless.

Yet I, too, am colonized [contained] (contaminated?)
I am colony, colonizer, and colonized
Puertorriqueño por reclamación
Por familia, por sangre
Told our lands were never ours
Shown that power wrested
Is not soon reclaimed.

Thousands of miles away,
I’ve sped to the coast
Not knowing
What burned me into
Dying bursts of the sun.
Searching, scanning
The buried horizon,
The swaths of fading waves
