I ordered an Old Cuban
In the whitest of towns.
Sure,
It’s progressive.
Sure,
You can smoke weed every second
On a sidewalk
That leads straight to
Banks and the bay.

But try some time to
Speak as you’re supposed to
Lips set in Spanish tones.
Greet the blank but smiling
Faces.
And remember they don’t give
A fuck either.
They’ll wash you away
With a wave
And a couple of nods.
