{"text":"Disappearing into neglected woods,\nPast a dirt path toward a tangle of trees,\nI scraped and I struggled\nThrough spiraling thorns embedded\nIn bark, in shade, in flesh.\nFor some troubled time, I shuffled and turned,\nI twisted and ducked, contortedly\nForging the wooded trail.<br><br>\nWith sweat on my lips and dust on my tongue,\nI wiped my brow, as fingers unfurled.\nOver thinning twigs and fallen trees,\nWith a final ascent, I reached for plains,\nOpen in air, searching the sky\nIts simple blue drifting through\nMy ever-wandering eye."}
