{"text":"I have found the limits/\nOf my body/\nThe heights it will let me climb/\nHand over hand/\nLimblike ladder/\nDisappearing in thick canopy layers/\nWhen I crouch in the high branches/\nI find my familiar edge/\nThe one I find when I sprint/\nFastflown blurry track/\nWhen I bounce, when I bound/\nAnd I am weightless./\nI sway. I float. I fly./"}
