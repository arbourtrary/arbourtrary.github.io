I’ve watched my feet follow dirt
That snaked thru tall grasses and
Strolled into streams of shade.
Soothed by the current and 
Cooled by the wind,
I was a fervent immortal
Whispering to leopards
Lost in discussions
Of the old parody.
A gambler’s duplicate die,
A lone hourglassed dune,
A saint’s faded halo:
These were my visions in youth.
Each world could halt.
In my heart, each breath
Could fizzle as waters 
Crashed for the sake of the moon.
