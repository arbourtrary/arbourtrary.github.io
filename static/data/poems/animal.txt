A silence engendered by the tipsy fall of leaves, 
A silence buoyed by the tingling wind.
Such vertigo, such precariously primal focus
Peers just too far past the thinning edge -
Broken! 
Crack! 
Sun-sapped sticks
With a rush, now, with a snap.
Quick scuttle of quicker feet.
Look, 
Relax, 
Remember – 
Slowly and smoothly.
Move the frame to a subtler fix.
Fasten your eyes and pray.
