“That’s a good question…”
What did you feel compelled to answer?
The truth? Did shame spur you? Did truth spurn you?
Had you deconstructed your flimsy self?
Did you ponder praise? Secretly pray
For misinterpretation? For reinvigoration?
I heard you trail off
Next breath building sharply in lungs ballooned
Heartbeat both stopped and pounding
Brain barely able to repeat
That little question.
