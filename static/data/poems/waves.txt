Softly now, a melody caresses the languid room:
It wafts in and out, high and low,
Traipsing aural boundaries 
With slight, swift staccatos 
Silenced by these slender, smooth legatos.	
Sometimes, just sometimes, I hear the whirl:
A fluid rush of flesh slicing the air,
Of fingers gliding ‘cross the keys.
They whisper, feel, dance, sing –
Enraptured by the movement,
Drawn precariously into the moment
I watch the world fluctuate,
Rising, falling, rising and falling
With every warm breath,
With each flickering lash.
