Buy me smoked, wrung out
On the line
Tobacco was made in the dry sun, an accident
I am cooked the same
Basted and blistered
In moonless heat

I am roughly sane
A spoke to B and B to me
We wrote it down
We crossed it out items
A tried some music.
B stared out the window.
My eyes gave out before my ears
So I felt for rumblings
Awful groans and yawns giving way
