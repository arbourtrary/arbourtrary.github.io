Green love coded the spectra
We consider -

Ran its shades
From r-hex to g to b.
Made displays fill
The black screen
Quicker than blinks,
Softer than joy.
But more visceral,
But less real.

You can’t imagine Spanish
Tiled rooftops
Until you’ve seen them
In this illumination.

Ninety degrees never
Looked so good -
Nested in parallax,
Rounded in close-cut
Shadows.
