In an unfortunate dissection of light,
Thirteen beams were splintered,
Shattered and shot into oblivion.
‘Twas a most regrettable occurrence
Engendered by the spatial limitations
Of some cluttered mind and a heavy soul.
Disappearing into obsolete Xanadus,
Most rays unsurprisingly remained afar.
After all, their collective was prime,
Their fate unintended, and their skill
Melodically unquestioned.

Yet one odd purveyor of iniquities,
Stricken by the throes of insomnia, 
(Chance affliction of madmen and kings)
Finally dreamt in jubilant ekstasis
Of the familiar fragrance of jasmine.
In a euphoric, unforgettable silence,
He halted.  Sweet memory infused
The spectral creature with unquenchable
Desire, and in a single infinite bound,
Recalling a singular path, the ray returned,
Piercing through the untold darkness.
