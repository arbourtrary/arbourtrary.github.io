At a distance,
The city's forest speaks
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Refuge

Near its edge,
The illusion breaks into boulevards,
Sidewalks winding toward some middle.

And once within the bounded woods,
Trees disperse
In ordered clumps,
Or garden rows.

They pose next to
Latin placard notes
Because we are forgetful.
Or scientific.
Or both.
