It floats, slows down, stops, retreats.
Perception staggers with the inconsistent flux of time
As mind wanders, fuzzy and numb,
And body slips into the swirling quicksand
That surrounds and usurps the senses,
Dissipating known and unknown forms.
Evoked by the bliss of vertigo
And oneiric shadows of sound,
Drooping eyelids invite this dream,
Injecting a soporific
Deep into lyrical maelstroms
That know not the stylistic Shades
Nor the thrill of the third paroxysm.
Indeed, as they say, from a haze
Emerges a buoyant subconscious,
Laboriously drawn forth by the inexplicable pleasure
Of having loosed the very fabric of being.
Intrigue, infinity, and the metaphysics of Mephistopheles,
Yes, even language and her sweetly disposed nullification
Intrinsically mesh and burn together
To create the microcosm of the blazed,
To unveil the fool and his folly.
