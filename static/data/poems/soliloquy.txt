Count me as a perpetual drifter of
Stoplights and stopsigns.

Highway exits gift better
Than city grates and subway stops.
They can exit here. Fast.
Guilt hides with time
Or faster yet, with distance

I took my shirt off
Cause I knew you’d stare
Bent kneeward, seated with business
In my gut,
Flesh, folded flesh
Shoe tie tries
Umbrellas and garbage.
You’ve seen me near dumpsters. In warm debris
Sun scalds and bloated arms blending
