Ten valves per
Square inch of your personal
Purview, dug in
Flutelike depth to the
Midnight terrain.

From one hundred feet high,
You can feign familiarity.

From cruising altitude,
The yellow-white, red-blue lamplights

Hypnotize.

They float in siloed unison
As bioluminescent snapshots.

They disappear with
Inescapable curvatures
Of horizons and shores.

They flare as vivid tattoos
With pointillist intrigue
Morphing
Into pointed vigilance.

The lights consolidate.
They brace

Against the hidden
Forests and farms.
