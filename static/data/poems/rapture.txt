Without a single thought of Kubla
Khan or the sound, illustrious Buddha,
I’ve sat at the edge of many rivers.

Some, I cannot recall without an
Insect buzz, a stinging ant.
Some, I cannot recall without
A longing that blurs
With the ease of eyes 
Falling blind.

In others still, I cannot recall myself –
I grow wild in observation
Struck by the spirit,
Kindling of a soul
Dried up,
And lit.
