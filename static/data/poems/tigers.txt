I built the slow-volt spine,
Vertebrae measured in mileage.

I placed its bones into
Precise locales.
I minimized
Severe disturbance.

I foresaw the coming
Catastrophes,
Which were well within
The margin of error.

Blue is a relentless color,
But the stones will not resist

(This time)

Arithmetic or logic.
