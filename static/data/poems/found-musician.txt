Brother Thelonius
Part time friend, full time friar
And patron saint of Bottled Bebop.&trade;

You give my frigid night
A needed warmth,
Bubbled in a brooding brew:
Imbibe it

Best absorbed on the sidewalk
Lifeline, sweet record
Slow-spinning inside.

That deft, adept set of hands
Playing the melodies that move them,
Keyboard spun in a halo,
Mindful crowd soaking it in.
