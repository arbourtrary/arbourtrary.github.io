A moment past my patience waiting in the woods,
A kind of endeavor stirs in my feet, my fingers,
A curiosity to learn how I interact.

Where can I glide?
Where am I just noise?
Will my limbs pull me skyward in oaken arms?
Will my stone skip as smooth, fast, effortless, inevitable
As the wave that will consume it?
