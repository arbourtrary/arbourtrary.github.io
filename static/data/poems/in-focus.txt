I have found the limits
Of my body
The heights it will let me climb
Hand over hand
Limblike ladder
Disappearing in thick canopy layers
When I crouch in the high branches
I find my familiar edge
The one I find when I sprint
Fastflown blurry track
When I bounce, when I bound
And I am weightless.
I sway. I float. I fly.
