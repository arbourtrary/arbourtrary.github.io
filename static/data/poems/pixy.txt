When I lost my mind to the dandelioned fields,
I felt a certain ease.
I sliced each linen
Of the spiral shell;
Mirrored rocks with recursive fades
Shine as fabled canyons shine
In a scarlet streaking sky;
Electric timbers in the morning
Are attenuated antennae
Twitching with the pulse of the sun;
Bridges lost to time or a door
Find solace in an eye’s embrace.
