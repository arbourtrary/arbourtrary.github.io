{"text":"Bluegrass, careful, unequivocal/\nSpiky here, shaved there,/\nEarthfur bristling,/\nCold in summer’s windy fever./\nThere is a gradual slope of green/\nThat picks up speed and picks up steam/\nAnd careens into a cliff/\nWhose bottom I dare not see./<br><br>\nBy that precipice,/\nThe patchy weeds/\nTell me there is no depth to this soil,/\nNothing firm in the footing./\nI should retreat to the shadow of trees,/\nLean against them,/\nLet my page wonder what goes on below./"}
