We’ve wrestled hunger,
Knotting itself in our empty mouths,
We've begged hard with thirst
Flaking our bloody lips.

So we’ve learned  to grip life close.

In our walled-off streets,
We ziptie flags
To tentpoles with clenched teeth.

On gray dawns we line sidewalks
To barricade against
The red and blue siren bluster.

If we break,
We stand up in our wake.

We roam untethered, 
Build it all again
Dispersed,
But never dispossessed.
