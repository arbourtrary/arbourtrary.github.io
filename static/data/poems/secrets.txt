Picture the orb in its animal form - 
Raw, foaming, fighting to breathe.
With noxious touch, that spark ignites,
Wakens the clouds to heavens above,
Rips the seas to livelier motion.
Feel the moments burst
Into brilliant scales.
If you can feel the whisper,
If you can touch the waves,
Then gather your senses, convert
Knowledge into comprehension,
Silence into conversation.
Each relic of the pumice pummeled past
Waits timeworn and timid,
For you, sweet discovery.
