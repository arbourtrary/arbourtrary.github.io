{"text":"Between the points of needled light\nWith a yarn of strung out clouds,\nI spin for you the sky soaked moss\nAnd weave these darkened leaves.\nI tread upon the softer limbs,\nHanging in the balance:\nAbove my eyes a branching web,\nI spiral close and limber.\nTreetop reaching, heaven wishing,\nI breathe for you the pinewood air,\nI feel the lightened breeze."}
