Reclamation is a passionless drum
That beats from the west.
A persistent baritone jumbled mess.
It leaves its brother
To mind the inland clearing.
Collapse. Dissolve. Reclaim.
Decay lies dormant
In every front yard, every pot,
Every gap in the pavement grid.
It thrives in the bayshore boglands
And rusty dogpatch husks.
It moves all along the railroad edge.
