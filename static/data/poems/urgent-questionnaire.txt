Could you tell me how many birds
You saw from the ground?
You saw in a dream?
You saw? You see?

Could you tell me
How many dreams
You saw in a bird?

Now bare your teeth,
Your barren teeth!

Fewer than two? Than three? Than ten?

Did you keep them all? 
Every one?
Have you flown
Just to fly?
Have you leaped
From the redwood trees?
Tell me how many
Dreams you need to know.
