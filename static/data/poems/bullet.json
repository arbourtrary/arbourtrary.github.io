{"text":"Aloof. \nYour soul will wonder\nIf you’ll make this choice\nAs irrevocable as the past,\nAs necessary as the rain\nAnd sleep that follows.<br><br>\nAloud.\nFuck this\nIntrospection – \nIt hounds\nThe tired centuries.<br><br>\nAlone.\nIt gives no pause \nTo those who would linger,\nAnd nothing\nTo those who stray."}
