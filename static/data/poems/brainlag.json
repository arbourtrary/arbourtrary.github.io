{"text":"The way your blood settles/\nInto timezones/\nThe quiet limits of body/\nAnd invention/\nThe strength of orbits/\nAnd spheres./\nWe belong to where we’ve been/\nSundown, stomach sluggish/\nVaulted into passive airspace/\nTough footing slowly found/\nWe stumble until we crash/\nOn couches or pillows/\nIn malingering afternoons/"}
