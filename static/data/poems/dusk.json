{"text":"Hanging loosely, my arms hover, sway,\nVeins vining toward each fingertip,\nSplaying a circular warmth\nTo soothe the quickened beat.\nI remember the flickering yellow,\nFireflies swift in the humid dark,\nSoon to be caught or lost to light.\nI remember the sleeping sky,\nEach moonrise warmer than the last,\nEach dawn far off and heavy.\nI remember your flaring nostrils\nOpen with each inhalation,\nBlooming with the night."}
