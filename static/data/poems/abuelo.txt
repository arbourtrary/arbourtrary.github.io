Between the points of needled light
With a yarn of strung out clouds,
I spin for you the sky soaked moss
And weave these darkened leaves.
I tread upon the softer limbs,
Hanging in the balance:
Above my eyes a branching web,
I spiral close and limber.
Treetop reaching, heaven wishing,
I breathe for you the pinewood air,
I feel the lightened breeze.
