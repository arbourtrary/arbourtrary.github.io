{"text":"Imagine the beauty:\nThe skipping of strings\nBegging to convey truth\nFrom your deep abstraction.\nFind the slow crescendo,\nTickling its sinuous way\nPast your palms\nInto wide-eyed wonder.\nSoftly bemused, now\nLet the longer cadence\nSmooth your twining sleep\nWith a distant, distant hush."}
