A curious, unkempt absorption,
Logs chopped, soaked and ragged,
Untimely, and no type of kindling.
Plaster sinews brought
Yard by yard by yard, lengthy yield,

Remittance of thatchery.

Every time I care less, or less, or less,
I am met by a wilderness
(Kinetic)
My body,
Lithe animal dropped,
Sharp or soft or
Heard and felt and endless.

Lifetimes could be there in the
Collision,
In the yielding.
