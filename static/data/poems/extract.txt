Allow me to recollect for you a piece of your imagination:
Between the sinewy matters, dimmed and gray,
Through willowy foresights, lightly betrayed.
You see: your dormant mariner, your flightless bird
Rose darkly from the deepening sea.
Cold ridges cracked, split by the seams,
And spilt into various dreams.
Twilight encircled, vulturing down
Shrouding the hint, the rhythm above,
Though feathery stalks and mossy stones
Lingered to play with time.
Before the frail descent of words unheard,
A final stream slipped in view,
Soft light swimming in ripples.
Here, your mirror slowed beyond motion,
Steeped in its wake,
Subdued in the stuff of perception.
