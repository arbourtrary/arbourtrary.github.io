I found it
In that alley yard
By the empty lot.

I don’t wanna move it.

I'll just snap, click,
And keep it
In a square frame
Til the day my followers fade.

I need to show them how beauty
Survives.

Forget the
&emsp;Barbed wire hooks
&emsp;Beaten shoe husks
&emsp;Compact syringe
&emsp;Urine-stain stench
&emsp;Makeshift tent and
&emsp;Another nauseating
&emsp;Needle.

Cause it’s 5:45 on a Tuesday
And those dusk-lit vines
Cradle the most
Stunning rose.
