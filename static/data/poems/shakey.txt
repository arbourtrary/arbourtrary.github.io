Rock splits to gravel to dust
And kicks away step by step,
Blows away wind-wise.
Can’t be seen much,
Can’t be felt much,
But each banjo strum
Brings it all a little closer.
Back together.
Texas heat cracks barn
Doors with paint lines
That branch, break and fold.
They’ve sharpened now,
So tend to the dry brush -
Cool the waterless air
With straw hat shadows,
And lacquer the oakwood boards.
Then wait and drop back.
Watch blazing hours give way
To a fire-glazed dusk.
