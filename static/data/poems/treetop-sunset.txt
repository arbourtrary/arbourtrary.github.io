I’m as close to the hunt
As I'll ever feel.

I sprint with a thrill
In the space behind my eyes,

Someone's heart beats me
Into the chase.

Light falls faster
Than my footsteps
Fly.

Half-shades glimmer in gold.
My eyes cannot reach them all.

And the birds!

Watch them far
Above -
The birds are almost home!
