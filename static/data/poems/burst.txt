Why would they call it
A ringing?
No one can answer.
There is neither
Clear end nor clear beginning.
Just an eventual fade.
Missed call. Voicemail.
Ears ringing (recuperating noise)
This is when you learn that
Not only your skin
Can be numb.
Your inmost birds can screech
With god-grafted lungs
Straightline flat
Unflappable tongues shooting from a
Distance fully within.
