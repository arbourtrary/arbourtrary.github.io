Landscapes like this one
Are so damn defined.
Block-bound planes play
Down
The frantic lives of ivy
Sprigs.
Square plots, fair plots
And the neighbor’s
Gravel trapezoids
Give strange birth
To trees propped up
By the ribs of their
Siblings.

I get it.
I mean…
I kinda see that I’m the same.
But I’m not so sure
That the others know.
Not so sure
They understand
The forest already got killed
For the trees.
