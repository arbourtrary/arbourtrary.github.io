He thought he was a captain.
Saw the Bay stretch wide
Behind him,

Saw the water narrow
Up ahead.

A hundred million tons of steel
Jam-packed into
Quiet boxes.

You see, he thought he was a captain - 
His ghost crew long gone
From the deck.

He thought he was a captain
Gone from the wheel,
Cargo drifting
Into certain conclusions.

You see, Rick - 
He thought he was a captain

But he plays the steel
Guitar
With a stomping
Barefoot beat.

He belts his Ozzie
Osbourne
With a fire
Buried deep.

He spits
His engine’s 
Burning steam
And blasts
Its bellowed horn.

He stands ablaze
Fronta the train

Cause he’s the
Damn
Conductor.
