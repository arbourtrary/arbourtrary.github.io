I love how fog
Will wisp its way 
On the backs of rumbling ships -
Move in from the open ocean, slow,
Beneath the belly of
The Golden Gate.

I love how it will rise,
Wrap the whole bridge in
Smoke.
And linger.

People like to jog there in the
Half-day.

Raptors like to swoop down,
Cover their tails
In closing 
Vapor.
