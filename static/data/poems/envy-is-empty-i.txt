I know how to be wealth adjacent
Almost rubbing shoulders, but I will always,
Unkempt, push away into wildernesses,
Reassociate with my brethren branches,
Leaves and foliage. I claim my hilltop
Opposite the fenced and manicured
Withering their bald rooftops and
Vacuumed lawns with disappointment across the valley
To create vacant spaces out of bounty:
This is the proprietary trick of the rich
I see ravens, circling, channeling,
Vulturing. They, too, sense a carcass.
