Hanging loosely, my arms hover, sway,
Veins vining toward each fingertip,
Splaying a circular warmth
To soothe the quickened beat.
I remember the flickering yellow,
Fireflies swift in the humid dark,
Soon to be caught or lost to light.
I remember the sleeping sky,
Each moonrise warmer than the last,
Each dawn far off and heavy.
I remember your flaring nostrils
Open with each inhalation,
Blooming with the night.
