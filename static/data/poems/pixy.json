{"text":"When I lost my mind to the dandelioned fields,\nI felt a certain ease.\nI sliced each linen\nOf the spiral shell;\nMirrored rocks with recursive fades\nShine as fabled canyons shine\nIn a scarlet streaking sky;\nElectric timbers in the morning\nAre attenuated antennae\nTwitching with the pulse of the sun;\nBridges lost to time or a door\nFind solace in an eye’s embrace."}
