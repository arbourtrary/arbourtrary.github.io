{"text":"I visited some familiar trees/\nSaw the old footholds, grips,/\nStretches, contortions and cradles./\nI imagined my forest seats/\nLeglocked and body balanced/\nI remembered these lithe and lovely wooded homes/\nMovements/\nOf lively springing/\nClimbing, gliding, silent things/\nWind in the weeds/\nI was guided, had strength to follow/\nBlessing of youth/\nMy wild, scattered heart"}
