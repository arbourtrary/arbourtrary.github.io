<h2>Rising Temperature</h2>
<p><b>Inspiration</b>: Desire to learn some more about LLM outputs and the 1:1 temperature mapping to the warming globe was a salient analogy for things melting down</p>

<p><b>Description</b>: I repeatedly asked an LLM to complete the sentence &ldquo;Climate change is _____ at +[0 - 2.5]&deg;C". And each time, I increased the LLM's response temperature (increases randomness) from <b>0</b> to <b>2.5</b>.

<p>This maps to the global warming temperatures above pre-industrial levels from <b>0&deg;C</b> to <b>2.5&deg;C</b>, a projected temperature we'll likely hit by the end of the century. As of <a href="https://wmo.int/news/media-centre/wmo-confirms-2024-warmest-year-record-about-155degc-above-pre-industrial-level" target="_blank">2024</a>, we were around <b>1.55&deg;C</b> above those levels.</p>

<p><b>Method</b>: I wanted to play with LLM outputs so I ended up using <a href="https://ollama.com/" target="_blank">ollama</a> with <a heref="https://www.llama.com/models/llama-3/" target="_blank">llama3</a> locally to have unfettered access to parameters like <i>temperature</i>, <i>top_k</i> and <i>top_p</i>. <i>Temperature</i> alone didn't drastically vary outputs for such a simple prompt. So I also increased <i>top_k</i> from <b>40</b> to <b>10,000</b> to capture unusual words and increased <i>top_p</i> from <b>0.9</b> to <b>.99</b> to make sure the unusual responses had a chance of being returned.</p>

<p>I found the simple 1-word fill-in-the-blank outputs easy to compare as the model repsonses melt down under increasing temperatures. I'm interested in the odd long-tail outputs of these models. The fabricated portmanteau of &ldquo;grimmanent" (grim + immanent) was fascinating for instance.</p>

<p>Also a reminder that we, both end users and model builders, barely scratch the surface of possible outputs. There is an art to what LLMs can present us and no guarantee it's responding optimally per prompt.</p>
