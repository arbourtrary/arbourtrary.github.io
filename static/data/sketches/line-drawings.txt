<h2>Line Drawings</h2>

<p><b>Inspiration</b>: (1) The beautiful, mazelike, single-line drawings by the Polish architect and engineer <a href="https://miguelabreugallery.com/exhibitions/grounding-vision-waclaw-szpakowski/" target="_blank">Wacław Szpakowski</a> (2) the serenity of Japanese <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_dry_garden" target="_blank">zen gardens</a> and (3) these kinetic art sand tables by <a href="https://sisyphus-industries.com/" target="_blank">Sisyphus</a></p>

<p><b>Description</b>: Wanted to make something slow and peaceful, developing on the page. Each animated drawing is a single, uninterrupted line. And all the drawings are vectorized versions of <b>Wacław Szpakowski's</b> original works. I kinda gave up (for now) on a programmatic way to trace his lines that maintained the sharp corners and straight lines. I tried some out-of-the-box Python skeletonization libraries, medial axis transforms, etc but nothing quite got it. So what remains are squiggly vectors derived from <a href="https://inkscape.org/" target="_blank">Inkscape's</a> &#8220;Bitmap Trace - Centerline" feature.</p>
