<h2>Cistercian Ciphers</h2>
<p><b>Inspiration</b>: (1) The Hungarian-monk-founded <a href="https://www.cistercian.org/">Cistercian</a> school I went to in Texas and (2) the code and cool project page on <a href="https://akosnikhazy.github.io/cistercian-numerals/">Cistercian numerals</a> by <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/yzahk.in">Ákos Nikházy</a></p>

<p><b>Description</b>: It turns out the Cistercians (an order of Catholic monks) created a numeric system that could represent the numbers 1 - 9999. The ciphers have nice symmetry and, with some practice, become quick to read. I annotated them up top to show the locations of the ones, tens, hundreds and thousands. A quick clickthrough has a fun sort of stick-figure flipbook aesthetic. Probably what they were going for with these runes...</p>
