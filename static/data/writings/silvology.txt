There are dim pockets in the woods, quiet places. Tree bark coursing with ants, crumbling branches, dark and humid. There's an allure to their stillness, unmistakable smell. Organic residue and soft ground. 

Forests tolerate them for years, decades - these future sites of resurrection. In the meantime they are mapped, understood by those within.

This refuge, deterministic, this midnight shift of unnoticed toil. Eerily calm as it writhes. Decay is a series of cliffs, sudden breaks into canyons.

I want to trace the line, electric. With another sense, myopic. There is a net, a flow, resilience, springy with the strength of life. Wily, clever little lines.

Can you build an essay this way, a poem? Should I dig up the supports? Less a maze, more a village-turned-town-turned-city. I don't know if time is cyclic, but matter has many methods of rebirth.

Scale carries itself into this dwelling as a visitor only. Moonless, sunless, vestiges appear and fade. A certain striving determination.

Illusion of breath, spaces between spaces / species. Thin workhorse, leafvein transporting pristine light. Lithe bend of top branch, far-reaching spirals.

It seems we have conquered death into dainty blooms. Suffocating green film. It is, again, mathematics, or some theory of it.

Maximize capture, minimize competition. Provide safe arbour to the flighty few.
