<p>Over the past decade I've lived in 14-ish apartments, 7 cities and 3 countries. It's a lot of movement. There's all kinds of pros / cons with so much change.</p>

<p>But I think my favorite part has been the repeated opportunity to wander. I love to be aimless, love the feeling of discovery.</p>

<p>After our latest move to another city, I'd been trying to find fun things to do with my 1 and 2 year old kids: parks, playgrounds, libraries.</p>

<p>I find it harder to be freeform with such little kids - having a plan puts me (and I think them?) more at ease. So naturally, I turned to the Internet and found some great things. Walkable spots. Close-by drives.</p>

<p>After a month of being here, though, I finally took some time for myself to just go on a random walk. No particular purpose. I ended up passing through the little city center, kept going into the town gardens that then turned to walking paths among rows of beautiful trees.</p>

<p>I took a left on a whim. It was foggy and through some pines, I saw a low fence, then a slide and swings and realized there was this magical little forest playground just sitting there. I was delighted. Couldn't wait to walk the 15 minutes back home, tell my kids and bring them over!</p>

<p>Later, I wondered how I'd missed this delightful spot, and it was simple. Just wasn't on Google Maps for whatever reason.</p>

<p>And that's the beauty of wandering. I could've easily settled into my planned routine, the places I'd already visited, and that would have sufficed.</p>

<p>I also could have done a more in-depth online search or looked at Google Maps satellite view, written a program to detect unknown playgrounds etc etc.</p>

<p>But the sheer serendipity of opening up to life can be so surprising and fulfilling. It brings me immense joy and peace to stumble upon some little marvel.</p>

<p>Sometimes, finding a clearing is as literal as happening upon a space set aside in a dense forest. Or finding the vast horizon at the top of a tree. Sometimes it's taking a few deep breaths, emptying your mind for a millisecond of calm.</p>
