<i>The most regretful people on earth are those who felt the call to creative work, who felt their own creative power restive and uprising, and gave to it neither power nor time.</i>

<i>\- Mary Oliver, wonder of a poet</i>

<br>
That quote tumbles around my mind some nights. Makes me think about the last decade, the next decade. Who I can still be.

Makes me think about all the poems I've written.

Maybe 1 out of every 100 or 200 scrawls, I find it. The right word, the delightful phrase, something utterly true.

I don't mind being a broken watch - it's all about volume. Try. Create. Fill the minutes with life, discovery.

Makes me dream about all the poems I'll write.

<i>Next year's words await another voice.</i>

<i>\- T.S. Eliot</i>
